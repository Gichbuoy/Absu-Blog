<h1>MPESA AND KENYA’S ECONOMY: THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY.</h1>
<p>The Kenyan economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Kenya has one of the highest rates of mobile phone penetration in Africa, at 89.6% and as more people get connected to the internet, they are also looking for new ways to make money from their phones.
<br> 
M-Pesa is a financial services company that helps Kenyans save and spend on their smartphones. In this article, I give you some insight into how this technological revolution is impacting Kenya's economy.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS M-PESA?</h2>
<p>M-Pesa is a mobile money transfer service in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The service allows users to store, send, and receive money via their mobile phones. M-Pesa was launched in 2007 by Safaricom, a Kenyan telecommunications company.<br>
The term M-Pesa simply means mobile money with ‘pesa’ being a Swahili tern for money. Initially it used to operate using text messages. It has grown to an application that easily facilitates financial transactions on the internet. 
M-Pesa has had a significant impact on Kenya's economy. In 2010, M-Pesa accounted for 10% of Kenya's GDP. By 2012, that number had grown to 25%. M-Pesa has also helped reduce poverty in Kenya. In 2009, the World Bank estimated that M-Pesa had lifted 194,000 households out of poverty.<br>
M-Pesa has also had a positive effect on other aspects of Kenyan life. For example, M-Pesa has helped improve access to financial services in rural areas. It has also been used to pay school fees and utility bills. In addition, M-Pesa has made it easier for Kenyans to send money home to family members who live in other parts of the country or abroad.</p>

<h2>THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL TECHONOLOGY AND MPESA IN KENYA.</h2>
<p>The impact of M-Pesa cannot be understated or overstated. In 2022 alone, the company transacted 30 trillion shillings which is thirty times the country’s annual financial budget.
The service has helped to increase access to financial services for millions of Kenyans who previously did not have access to formal banking services. M-Pesa has also helped to reduce the cost of sending and receiving money, making it easier for businesses to operate in Kenya.<br>
The success of M-Pesa in Kenya has led to the launch of similar services in other countries, such as Tanzania and India. M-Pesa is also helping to drive the adoption of mobile banking and other financial technologies in Africa.</p>

<h2>HOW MPESA CHANGED OUR DAILY LIVES.</h2>
<p>In Kenya, mobile money is everywhere. From street hawkers to shopkeepers to bus drivers, almost everyone accepts and uses mobile money. This revolution in financial technology has had a profound impact on daily life in Kenya.
With mobile money, Kenyans can quickly and easily send and receive payments. This has made it easier to conduct business, pay for goods and services, and transfer money to friends and family. Mobile money has also helped to reduce the cost of living for many Kenyans by eliminating the need for expensive banking services.
By making it easier for people to conduct business and access financial services, mobile money has helped to spur economic growth and create jobs. In addition, mobile money has helped to increase tax revenue for the government by making it easier for businesses to pay taxes electronically.<br>
Overall, mobile money has had a positive impact on daily life in Kenya. It has made it easier for people to conduct business, pay for goods and services, and transfer money to friends and family. Mobile money has also helped to reduce the cost of living for many Kenyans by eliminating the need for expensive banking services.</p>

<h2>BENEFITS OF MPESA:</h2>
<p>M-Pesa has given numerous benefits to its users as well as the country’s economy. Perhaps most notably, it has helped to increase financial inclusion by providing access to financial services for those who previously did not have access. This is particularly important in a country like Kenya where approximately two-thirds of the population is unbanked.<br>
M-Pesa has also helped to boost economic activity by making it easier for people to send and receive money. This is especially beneficial for small businesses who can now more easily accept payments from customers. In addition, M-Pesa has also played a role in reducing corruption by making it more difficult for public officials to demand bribes in exchange for services.</p>

<h2>DRAWBACKS OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY IN KENYA.</h2>
<p>In Kenya, financial technology (fintech) has had a profound impact on the economy, particularly in terms of increasing access to financial services. However, there are also some drawbacks to fintech in Kenya that should be considered.
One major drawback is the lack of regulation around fintech. This has led to some concerns about the safety and security of using fintech platforms, as well as worries about scams and fraud. Additionally, because there is no regulation, there is also no protection for consumers if something goes wrong.<br>
Another downside to fintech in Kenya is that it has created a two-tiered system when it comes to financial inclusion. Those who can afford to use fintech platforms and have access to the internet are able to benefit from the convenience and lower costs associated with fintech. However, those who cannot afford these things are still left behind.
Finally, it's worth noting that fintech is still a relatively new phenomenon in Kenya (and indeed in many other parts of the world). As such, there is still much we don't know about its long-term impact on the economy. For example, we don't yet know how sustainable the current model of mobile money is. There is also a risk that over-reliance on fintech could lead to even greater inequality if not managed properly.
<br>
All in all, M-Pesa is one of the fastest growing organizations in Kenya and East Africa. It has helped many people access financial services and improve their lifestyle.</p>
